# NLP-Sentiment-analysis-using-Machine-Learning-and-flask

Utilizing Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, this project employs machine learning algorithms to perform sentiment analysis on textual data. Implemented with Flask, a Python web framework, it provides a user-friendly interface for inputting text and receiving sentiment predictions in real-time. By combining the power of NLP and machine learning with the simplicity of Flask, this project offers a seamless solution for analyzing and understanding the sentiment expressed in text.
